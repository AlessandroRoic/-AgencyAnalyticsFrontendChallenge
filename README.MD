## AgencyAnalytics Front End Challenge

Following the challenge instructions I build a gallery app using React.

Libraries used:

- React w/ Typescript
- React Redux
- React Testing Library / Jest
- Styled Components

I've included two tests for GalleryItem & the gallery slice.

I've also used firebase to deploy the website online: [check it out](https://agencyanalyticsfechallenge.web.app/);

With the use of Github Actions to automate the deploy (check out the .github folder and the Actions Tab for more information)
